Delighted to share my latest project on "Telangana Growth Analysis" using Power BI! 📈

Ever wondered how Telangana is shaping its future? 
I delved deep into Stamp Registration, Transportation, and Ts-Ipass data to uncover compelling insights. 
Here are just a few of the questions I answered:

1️⃣ Which districts in Telangana saw the highest document registration revenue growth from FY 2019 to 2022? 🏘️
2️⃣ Is there a shift from traditional document registration to e-stamp challans in certain districts? 💼
3️⃣ Do vehicle sales correlate with specific months or seasons in Telangana? 🚗
4️⃣ Which sectors attracted the most significant investments in FY 2022? 💰
5️⃣ Are there any seasonal patterns in investment trends for specific sectors? 🌦️

But that's just the tip of the iceberg! 🧊

I have also included additional research to explore commercial property insights and government policies' impact on Telangana's growth.

I'm eager to hear your valuable thoughts and insights—your feedback is greatly appreciated. Feel free to share your comments! 💬👇
